# Comp790: Computational Biology

## Logistical Details
Instructor: Natalie Stanley

Email: TBD

Time: Tuesday/Thursday 9:30am-10:45am

Office Hours: TBD

## Description
Moden assays allow us to efficiently profile multiple biological processes at a systems-level. Many of the recently developed technologies are 'high-throughpt', in that they generate an abundance of detailed information that needs to be extracted, analyzed and interpreted. In this course we will discuss the methodology used to analyze (process, engineer features, combine, etc.) data generated by some of the most cutting-edge technologies, such as proteomics, single-cell assays, and imaging in biomedicine. We will further discuss the intersection of modern machine learning techniques and how they can be applied to most effctively extract information from these modalities for an improved understanding of human health and disease.

## Prerequistes
To get the most out of the presented material, I suggest a strong programming background in at least one of the following (Python, R, Julia, or Matlab), experience with linear algebra and basic probability and statistics. Please feel free to talk to me about any of these.

## Course Structure
This course will be mostly lecture-based with two homework assignments and a course project. I will provide ideas for several publicly available biological datasets and open problems for you to work on. This will give you an opportunity to implement/apply methodology discussed in the papers that we will discuss together. You are welcome to work on teams for this project.

Most of the lectures will be based around several papers. To benefit your own understanding, I will provide a set of questions that should be answered for one of the papers discussed in each lecture.

## Homework
There will be two homework assignments to translate concepts into code. Often, things can become a bit easier to understand and use when they are implemented by you. :) I will be happy to read/run code written in Python, R, Julia, or Matlab. 

## Background Resources
Most of what we discuss in class will come from papers. However, I suggest the following textbooks as background references. Conveniently, they are also available for free as PDFs.

* Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning-- Chris Bishop // http://users.isr.ist.utl.pt/~wurmd/Livros/school/Bishop%20-%20Pattern%20Recognition%20And%20Machine%20Learning%20-%20Springer%20%202006.pdf

* All of Statistics-- Larry Wasserman // http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~larry/all-of-statistics/

* The Matrix Cookbook // https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~hwolkowi/matrixcookbook.pdf

## Readings
For each class, I will share the papers that we will go over. You will only be required to write a summary of one of the potentially multiple papers assigned for that day.
