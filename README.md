## Description
Moden assays allow us to efficiently profile multiple biological processes at a systems-level. Many of the recently developed technologies are 'high-throughpt', in that they generate an abundance of detailed information that needs to be extracted, analyzed and interpreted. In this course we will discuss the methodology used to analyze data generated by some of the most cutting-edge technologies (e.g. proteomics, single-cell assays, imaging.. etc) in biomedicine. We will further discuss the intersection of modern machine learning techniques and how they can be applied to most effctively extract information from these modalities for an improved understanding of human health and disease.

## Course Structure
This course will be mostly lecture-based with two homework assignments and a course project. I will provide ideas for several publicly available biological datasets and open problems for you to work on. This will give you an opportunity to implement/apply methodology discussed in the papers that we will discuss together. You are welcome to work on teams for this project.

Most of the lectures will be based around several papers. To benefit your own understanding, I will provide a set of questions that should be answered for one of the papers discussed in each lecture.
